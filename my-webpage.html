        <hr3>How to Beat <strong>Kanto</strong> League:</hr3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lorelei is the first Elite Four champion you face on Indigo Plateau. Her roster consists of strong Ice Type Pokemon.
            Lorelei's Ice Types will be weak against Electric and/or Grass Types. Use this knowledge to train these specific Pokemon when you're ready to face her.</li>
            <li>Bruno's lineup consists of Fighting Type Pokemon. Bring Water and Psychic Pokemon during your battle and you'll overcome him easily.</li>
            <li>Don't let her physical looks fool you! Agatha is the 3rd Elite Four champion you must face and she holds powerful Ghost Type Pokemon in her hands! Pokemon with powerful Psychic and Ground Type moves and techniques will be extremely effective against Agatha's Ghost Types.</li>
            <li>Lance will be the last Elite Four Champion you need to beat to get to the Pokemon League Champion. He has a roster full of Dragon Type Pokemon. Lance's Dragon Type Pokemon are weak to Electric or Ice Type moves. Be sure to train and bring these types of Pokemon to this battle!</li>
            <li>When facing the Champion or your Rival, you'll combat his line-up of diverse Pokemon. His party consists of Flying, Grass, Fire, Water, Ground, and Electric Types. Pidgeot, the Champion's first batter will have the ability to Mega Evolve during this battle. The Mega Pidgeot will be extremely agile, and most likely take the first strike unless your Pokemon is highly levelled. Try placing a tanky Pokemon as your first in line.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr3>How to Beat <strong>Sinnoh</strong> League:</hr3>
        <ol>
            <li>The first Elite Four member is Aaron, who uses Bug-type Pokémon. His Yanmega and Vespiquen are not hard to defeat and they're both 4x weak against Rock-type moves. His Scizor and Heracross are slightly easy to beat and Scizor is 4x weak against Fire-type moves, while Heracross is 4x weak against Flying-type moves. His Drapion is slightly hard to beat, but is weak against Ground-type moves. Get your Pokémon team around Level 51 before taking him on.</li>
            <li>The second Elite Four member is Bertha, who uses Ground-type Pokémon. She might be the second Elite Four member, but her Pokémon have many weaknesses. Her Whiscash is slightly easy to beat and is 4x weak against Grass-type moves. Here Golem isn't hard to beat, while her Rhyperior is, but they're both 4x weak against Water-type and Grass-type moves. Her Hippowdon is slightly hard to beat, but is weak against Water-type, Grass-type and Ice-type moves. Here Gliscor isn't hard to beat and is 4x weak against Ice-type moves. Get your Pokémon team around Level 53 before taking her on.</li>
            <li>The third Elite Four member is Flint, who uses Fire-type Pokémon. He's tougher than Aaron and Bertha, so make sure your Pokémon team is healed up before challenging him. His Houndoom, Rapidash and Flareon are slightly easy to beat, while his Infernape and Magmortar are slightly hard to beat. All of his Pokémon are commonly weak against Water-type and Ground-type moves. Get your Pokémon team around Level 55</li>
            <li>The fourth Elite Four member is Lucian, who uses Psychic-type Pokémon. He's even harder to beat than Flint, so make sure your Pokémon team is healed up before challenging him. His Bronzong is hard to beat, but is weak against Fire-type moves. His Mr. Mime is easy to beat, while his Alakazam, Gallade and Espeon aren't, but they're all commonly weak to Ghost-type moves. Get your Pokémon team around Level 57 before taking him on.</li>
            <li>All of her Pokémon (except Roserade) are hard to beat. Her Spiritomb has no weakness, so you're going to have to hit it with your strongest attack. Her Garchomp, Togekiss and Roserade are commonly weak against Ice-type moves. Her Milotic is weak against Electric-type and Grass-type moves. Her Lucario is weak against Fire-type, Fighting-type and Ground-type moves. Get your Pokémon team around Level 60 before taking her on.</li>
